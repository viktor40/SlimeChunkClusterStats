This program calculate the statistical probability of finding a slime cluster of a given size within a world.
It also calculates to probability of finding one in any seed. If the probability is bigger than 1 it means you're
expecting to find more than 1 of that size of cluster.

In config, the `WORLD` and `SEED` parameters are used to pick which parts of the code you want to run.
